# Presenting Mediterranean Relief UI to Judges

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "Cyprus Care is a crisis relief coordination platform.
> We developed a unique **Mediterranean Relief UI** design system,
> inspired by the Cypriot Mediterranean: orange fire and sunsets,

>
> Every element is designed for elderly users: large buttons,
> high contrast, simple architecture.
>
> **In a crisis, simplicity saves lives.**"

> Green gives hope — symbol of recovery after crisis."

### "How did you test accessibility?"

> "We used:
>
> - WCAG 2.1 contrast checker for all color combinations
> - Verified minimum touch target sizes (44x44px WCAG)
> - Tested with screen readers
> - Verified keyboard navigation
> - All focus states are visible and clear"

### "Is this responsive?"

> "Yes, fully. We used mobile-first approach.
> All touch targets increased, grid layouts adapt,
> typography scales. Show on phone if possible."

### "How long did theme development take?"
